The Project Management Committee (PMC) for Apache Kyuubi
has invited [Zhou Yifan](https://github.com/zhouyifan279) to become a committer and we are pleased
to announce that he has accepted.

Zhou Yifan made important contributions to Kyuubi's Kerberos support.

Being a committer enables easier contribution to the
project since there is no need to go via the patch
submission process. This should enable better productivity.
A PMC member helps manage and guide the direction of the project.

Please join me in congratulating Zhou Yifan!
