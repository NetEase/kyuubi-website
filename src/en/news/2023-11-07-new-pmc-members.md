The Project Management Committee (PMC) for Apache Kyuubi has invited [Zhen Wang](https://github.com/wForget) to become our PMC member and we are pleased to announce that he has accepted.

Zhen Wang is currently working at iQIYI. The PMC observed his passion for the Kyuubi project and the community over the past two years or so. Not only for his significant code contributions admittedly making him one of our most active contributors and demonstrating his expertise and commitment to the project, but also for his efforts in pitching the project and answering questions from users, being a release manager for several releases.

Please join me in congratulating Zhen Wang!
