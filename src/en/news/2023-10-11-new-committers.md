The Project Management Committee (PMC) for Apache Kyuubi
has invited [Binjie Yang](https://github.com/zwangsheng) to become a committer and we are pleased
to announce that he has accepted.

Binjie Yang works at NetEase Games, he

- started contribution to Kyuubi community since Mar. 2021

- participate in Kyuubi On Kubernetes adaptation and integration test construction
- join the construction of Kyuubi Web UI & Restful Api V2

Being a committer enables easier contribution to the
project since there is no need to go via the patch
