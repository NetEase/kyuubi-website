With JDBC/ODBC, users can access kyuubi and run queries efficiently through SQL directly or generated by BI tools. Kyuubi caches background engine instances at the user level for better computing resource sharing and quick response. They parallelize queries on large amounts of data and return the results quickly."

Kyuubi also provides multi catalog meta APIs that present a sizeable centralized picture of all your data in front of you and help you innovate faster. The ability to query disparate data sources in a single entrance with the ANSI standard SQL syntaxes greatly simplifies data insight while providing authentication and authorization to keep all data secure."
